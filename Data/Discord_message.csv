Discord itself is having an activity contest. for example when you join a VC you can open up games like checkers or whatever, 

Discords contest is in SDK and has to be web based. 

If yall really want DCL to be put on the map, Discord is a huge avenue. 

Imagine a DCL activity button that when you press it, it opens up a DCL name world(s) and you can be in the call with your friends in the mini DCL thats in calls",,

Of wallet numbers. + if also can collect there social medias so we can let them know they can claim these free DCL Dinos. Open to other ideas as well. Example here is the list of people spent most in Decentraland marketplace or bought most wearables but it only lists top 5. Would like to figure out how we can find more like on opensea etc. May take even a full day of work so open to all rates and time frames. Thanks in advance!,,
